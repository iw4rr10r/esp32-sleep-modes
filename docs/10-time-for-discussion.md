## Time For Discussion

We have come to the end of this tutorial. I hope you enjoyed it, and that you found some recipes to reproduce in your personal projects. I hope I didn't make it too boring and, at the same time, I hope I've gone into enough detail to make sure you understood it. If there are still some grey areas, I encourage you to come and discuss with me on the dedicated thread of the RNT Lab forum.

[Leave me a message][discussion]{: .btn .btn-purple }
{: .center }

I'll try to answer your questions as quickly as possible.

I look forward to hearing from you...

## Full Code Access

You'll find my full code available on [GitHub][github].
